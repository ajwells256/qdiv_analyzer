# Qualified Dividend Analyzer

Readme largely TBD, along with this project. It should be functional, if you can figure it out.

See https://github.com/ajwells256/1099-Parser / https://pypi.org/project/parse-1099/ to help source a csv of dividends from a 1099-DIV or 1099 Consolidated PDF.

To run:
`$ python3 security_analyzer.py -h`

## TODO
- Flesh out readme
- Package the project into something sensible and publish to pypi
